# loan_predicton_application
This project uses machine learning to predict loan defaults. It covers data preprocessing, feature selection (Variance Threshold, RFE, SHAP), class imbalance handling with SMOTE, model training/evaluation, and SHAP explainability. Results are visualized in Power BI and deployed interactively with Streamlit.
